keep it DRY dont repeat yourself while coding


FUNCTIONS allways start with a verb

VARIABLES name them as a noun

ARRAYS name them as plural nouns



Scope is the ruleset that js follow

in js every function has its own scope("dictornanry")

don't use global variables

  }
  else if(number >= 30){
 
   return "Too Old";
 
 }

}
